# My Trip to New Orleans

In April of 2019 I took my very first trip to the city of New Orleans. I had been inspired to visit after watching a travel vlog on YouTube by [Kristen and Siya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGV5kfjCzgM) in which they eat a bunch of very yummy looking food and explore the city. 

My brother Mars and my friend Shannon also came with me and we spent the week eating, drinking and having a good 'ol time. 

## The top 5 highlights of our trip
-----------------------------------

1. Eating the **best** corn grits at [Melba's](https://melbas.com/) while enjoying one of their many flavors of Daiquiri. Melba's describes their corn grits as 
> Creamy yellow corn grits with whole kernel corn and LOVE.

and you can _really_ taste the love (which may be secret code for butter)!

2. Wandering the [Botanical Gardens](https://neworleanscitypark.com/botanical-garden)  and seeing the many many art installations. Sadly since we were there during the week, the Amusement Park was closed. 

3. Watching _my brother_ play on stage at The Maison.

4. Taking the ferry across the river to get a tradional Pimm's Cup at the Crown and Anchor.

5. Watching two women have a powdered sugar fight at Cafe Du Monde (_while we ate Beignets, of course_).
